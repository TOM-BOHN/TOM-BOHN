## üöÄ Recent Data Science Projects

### üé® Computer Vision & Image Processing
| Date | Type | Repo | Description | Status |
|------|------|------|-------------|--------|
|2025 Sept|TensorFlow CycleGAN|[deep-learing-gan-monet-painting](https://github.com/TOM-BOHN/MsDS-deep-learing-gan-monet-painting/tree/main)|Generate Monet-style paintings from photographs using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), specifically a CycleGAN architecture. The goal was to learn and replicate the distinctive artistic style of Claude Monet‚Äîhis color palette, brush strokes, and use of light‚Äîto perform an artistic style transfer.|Completed|
|2025 Aug|TensorFlow CNN|[deep-learing-cnn-cancer-detection](https://github.com/TOM-BOHN/MsDS-deep-learing-cnn-cancer-detection)| Develop and evaluate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the binary classification of histopathologic images, specifically to detect the presence of metastatic cancer in image patches from the PatchCamelyon (PCam) dataset.|Completed|

### üìù Natural Language Processing
| Date | Type | Repo | Description | Status |
|------|------|------|-------------|--------|
|2025 Sept|TensorFlow LSTM|[deep-learing-rnn-disaster-tweets ](https://github.com/TOM-BOHN/MsDS-deep-learing-rnn-disaster-tweets)|Deep learning model to classify tweets, determining whether they pertain to real-world disasters. By leveraging a dataset of 10,000 hand-classified tweets, the primary objective was to build a recurrent neural network (RNN) capable of accurately distinguishing between disaster-related and non-disaster-related tweets. This task is crucial for emergency response organizations and news agencies that monitor social media for real-time information.|Completed|
|2024 Oct|Python Unsupervised NLP|[unsupervised-nlp-sfdc-classification](https://github.com/TOM-BOHN/MsDS-unsupervised-nlp-sfdc-classification)| Explores the application of unsupervised learning models to categorize large volumes of Salesforce help documentation. Salesforce, like many software companies, produces extensive documentation, which can be challenging to organize into categories. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP), features from 1,498 documents across Salesforce's Service Cloud and Sales Cloud were extracted to identify clusters and relationships in the text.|Completed|
|2024 Oct|Python Supervised NLP|[supervised-nlp-auto-classification-for-sfdc-documentation](https://github.com/TOM-BOHN/MsDS-supervised-nlp-sfdc-auto-classification)| Develop a natural language processing (NLP) model to automate the classification of Salesforce documentation across various product features and cloud services, such as Sales Cloud and Service Cloud.|Completed|
|2023 Sept| Python Unsupervised Learning| [news-articles-categorization](https://github.com/TOM-BOHN/MsDS-news-articles-categorization/blob/main/news-articles-categorization.ipynb) |A report focused on modeling news artical categorization for BBC News focused on the application of natural language processing, unsupervised learning with matrix factorization, and a comparison to supervised learning.|Completed|
|2023 Sept| Supervised Deep Learning |[marketing_text_classification](https://github.com/TOM-BOHN/MsDS-marketing-text-classification/blob/main/marketing_text_classification.ipynb) |A report focused on modeling news article categorization for marketing analytics. This notebook focuses on the application of natural language processing, supervised learning with k-train (a wrapper for Tensorflow, Keras, and Huggingface Transformers), and a evaluation of performance.|Completed|

### ü§ñ Traditional Machine Learning
| Date | Type | Repo | Description | Status |
|------|------|------|-------------|--------|
|2023 Aug| Python Supervised Learning | [customer-churn-prediction](https://github.com/TOM-BOHN/MsDS-customer-churn-prediction/blob/main/customer_churn_prediction.ipynb) |In this report, I will play the role of data scientist. Stepping out of my business-facing role and working with a similar model that was created to predict customer attrition. While I cannot use proprietary business data for this analysis, I will find and use a publicly available customer churn dataset to emulate a similar customer context. I will also use the Random Forest classifier package, similar to the model that was implemented at the company.|Completed|

### üìà Data Visualization & Analysis
| Date | Type | Repo | Description | Status |
|------|------|------|-------------|--------|
|2023 April| Python Data Vizualization | [consumer-price-index](https://github.com/TOM-BOHN/MsDS-consumer-price-index/blob/main/CPI_Visualization_Project.ipynb) |While the CPI news release and charts are thorough, they focus on the top-level CPI number. This is effective at describing the why behind inflation, but given the amount of aggregation, this package falls short of successfully communicating the "so what" of changes in CPI and inflation to the average person.|Completed|
|2023 April| R Analysis | [nypd-shooting](https://github.com/TOM-BOHN/MsDS-nypd-shooting/blob/main/NYPD%20Shooting%20Incident%20Data%20Report.Rmd) | Analysis of NYPD Shooting Incident Data to identify factors and trends contributiong to shootings in New York City.|Completed|
|2023 April| R Analysis | [covid-19](https://github.com/TOM-BOHN/MsDS-covid-19/blob/main/covid19%20Data%20Report.Rmd) | Analysis of COVID-19 data for global and US datassets. Exploratory data anlaysis in R to identify how the data interacts and connects.|Completed|
